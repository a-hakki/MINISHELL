## 📌 Wildcard Expansion Rules (`*`)

### ✅ You Should Expand Wildcards (`*`) **only if all are true**:

1. 🔓 The wildcard is **not inside quotes**  
   - `'*.txt'` or `"*.txt"` → ❌ Do not expand (treated as literal string)

2. - ❌ No expansion for:  
     - `export`
     - `unset`

3. 🧬 The wildcard is **not part of a variable name or value**  
   - `export FILE=*` → ❌ Do not expand (already handled ✅)

### ---------------------
1. 1 try to insert the wildcard function to our code + function to check if we have to expand it or not
